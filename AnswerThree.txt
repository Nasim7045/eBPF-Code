Problem Statement 3: Explain the code snippet

Explain what the following code is attempting to do? You can explain by:
Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?
Giving use-cases of what these constructs could be used for.
What is the significance of the for loop with 4 iterations?
What is the significance of make(chan func(), 10)?
Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}

1. Channel Creation (make(chan func(), 10))
go
cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
Creates a buffered channel that can hold up to 10 func() values

The channel carries functions that take no arguments and return nothing

The buffer size of 10 means it can hold 10 functions before blocking on sends

2. For Loop with 4 Iterations
go
for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
    go func() {
        for f := range cnp {
            f()
        }
    }()
}
Starts 4 goroutines (lightweight threads)

Each goroutine:

Continuously receives functions from the channel (range cnp)

Executes each received function (f())

The 4 iterations mean we have 4 concurrent workers all processing functions from the same channel

This is a common worker pool pattern where multiple workers process jobs from a shared queue

3. Sending a Function to the Channel
go
cnp <- func() {
    fmt.Println("HERE1")
}
Sends an anonymous function to the channel

The function, when executed, will print "HERE1"

4. Why "HERE1" Doesn't Get Printed
The main goroutine sends the function to the channel but exits immediately after printing "Hello"

When the main goroutine exits, the program terminates, killing all child goroutines

There's a race condition - the worker goroutines might not get a chance to:

Receive the function from the channel

Execute it
before the program exits

5. Use Cases
This pattern is useful for:

Worker pools where you want to distribute tasks across multiple goroutines

Asynchronous task processing

Controlling concurrency (here limited to 4 workers)

Building event-driven systems where functions represent events

6. How to Fix It
To ensure "HERE1" gets printed, you could:

Add a synchronization mechanism (like sync.WaitGroup)

Add a small sleep before main exits (not recommended for production)

Close the channel and have workers exit when done (more elegant)

Example Fix:
go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    
    close(cnp) // Close channel to signal workers to exit
    wg.Wait()  // Wait for all workers to finish
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
